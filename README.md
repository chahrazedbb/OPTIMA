# OPTIMA: Optimal Virtual Data Model for Querying Large Heterogeneous Data
OPTIMA is an Ontology-Based Big Data Access (Smeantic Data Lakes) that supports two types of virtual data model GRAPH and TABULAR and predicts the optimal one based on the SPARQL query behavior using deep learning algorithm.

Currently OPTIMA integrates:
- Two different virtual data models, GRAPH and TABULAR, to join and aggregate data.
– Deep learning method to select automatically the optimal virtual model based on query.
– It implements the state-of-the-art Big Data engines Apache Spark and Spark Graphx and supports out-of-the-box five data sources Neo4j, MongoDB, MySQL, Cassandra and CSV.

To enable the reproducibility of OPTIMA, we refer first to the baiscs on the following  Wiki page: [OPTIMA Basics](https://github.com/). which also helps understand the installation steps hereafter.
